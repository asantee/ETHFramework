Ethanon engine base framework with game state manager, simple UI system, samples and other utilities

Ethanon Programming patterns:

-Use g_ on globals
-Use m_ on members
-Use UPPER_CASE_LETTERS on constants
-Use UPPER_CASE_LETTERS on funcdef's
-Singleton classes with prefix s (e.g. sGlobalScale)
-Include all files in a single IncludeModules.angelscript
-All helper functions shall be in their own "header" file with their own variations and overloads
-Misc utility functions must be grouped in util- prefixed files  (e.g. utilSprite.angelscript)
-Functions that are directly related to a class functionality range may be placed along with the main class definition (e.g. class Interpolator and function interpolate(...))
