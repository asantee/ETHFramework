The project is a base framework for Ethanon engine with game state manager, basic UI control and many other utilities.

In order to use it, simply #include "IncludeModules.angelscript" to your main file.

For an example of basic use, check Samples/main.angelscript

NOTE: it will always/only be compatible with the latest versions of Ethanon Engine (in its respository)

Ethanon Programming style and patterns:

-Globals have g_ prefix (e.g. g_gameSaveManager)
-Members have m_ prefix (e.g. m_speed)*
-Use UPPER_CASE_LETTERS on constants
-Use UPPER_CASE_LETTERS on funcdef types
-Singleton classes must have the 'S' letter as prefix (e.g. SGlobalScale)
-Include all files in a single IncludeModules.angelscript
-All helper functions shall be in their own "header" file along with their own variations and overloads
-Misc utility functions must be grouped in util- prefixed files  (e.g. utilSprite.angelscript)
-Functions that are directly related to a class functionality range may be placed along with the main class definition file (e.g. class Interpolator and function interpolate(...))
-All singletons must be available anytime, anywhere

*Unless it's just a data storage class (like vector3)
